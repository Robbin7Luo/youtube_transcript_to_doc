      "The Descender is a versatile all-mountain directional snowboard designed for advanced riders. It offers a balance of power and control, enabling users to comfortably engage in backcountry freestyle and tackle large lines. Constructed with a moderate sidecut, the board performs well at various speeds and excels in edge grip due to the addition of extra contact points near the insert positions.\n",

      "The design, enhanced by feedback from prominent Swedish free riders like the two-time Big Mountain champion Steph, features a camber with a low profile of five millimeters, extending past the insert positions. This is complemented by a parabolic camber curve to maintain pop and drive, especially under the rear foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "With an 8.9-meter sidecut on the 161 model, the board's design aims to provide agility that often lacks in traditional big mountain snowboards. The top sheet sports a matte gray, semi-translucent finish that showcases the natural wood grain and features an image of a mountain range captured on a notable powder day in Sestriere.\n",

It offers enough tail for switch landings and the robust build needed to charge down demanding terrains.
